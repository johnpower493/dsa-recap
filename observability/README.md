# Observability (Senior-Level Focus)

This module focuses on **data observability, reliability, and incident response**.

## Core Topics

- SLA/SLO definitions for data products
- Freshness, volume, and schema anomaly detection
- Lineage and impact analysis
- Runbooks and incident response
- Cost + performance monitoring

## Exercises

1. **Freshness Checks**
   - Define SLAs for critical tables
   - Monitor and alert on freshness failures

2. **Volume Anomaly Detection**
   - Track daily row counts and alert on variance

3. **Incident Runbook**
   - Create a runbook for late-arriving data

4. **Lineage Review**
   - Identify downstream consumers and blast radius
